# Electronics-Design-for-Miniaturized-Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle
Source code for Initial operation and testing of the electronic sub-systems of an AUV

The novel underwater vehicle shall enable the fully autonomous exploration of ice-shelve undersides and subglacial lakes. 
Besides sensing and actuation, the vehicle contains different electronic sub-systems for housekeeping, intra-vehicle communication and energy distribution.

-Prototyping and assembly of electronic sub-systems in accordance with the system requirements.
-Initial operation and testing of the electronic sub-systems.

The main purpose is to collect the data regarding the health of the nano vehicle using a hydrophone and get this data into the computer.
The project includes 3 main parts:
-Data Acquisition miniaturisation using microcontroller.
-Amplifier miniaturisation.
-Miniaturisation of Hydrophone.
